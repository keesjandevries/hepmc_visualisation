Complilation:
============

For this functionality to work, you need to install HepMC
go to icgapp.cern.ch/project/simu/HepMC/download/
Click on "source" on the right.

Install HepMC-*.*.* as usual:
- untar
- go in directory
- configure with the momentum and length specified, e.g. "./configure --with-momentum=GEV --with-length=MM"
- make


Then install this package:
- go back to hepmc_visualisation
- open compile.sh and change the  "HepMC-*.*.*/test/" - directory
- do ./compile.sh (the file ./testHepMC.cc gets copied into HepMC-*.*.*/test/ and compiles there) 

Usage:
=====
- changes can be made in testHepMC.cc
- change and run "run.sh" 
- run latex_test.sh (press q if an error is thrown)
- open test.pdf
